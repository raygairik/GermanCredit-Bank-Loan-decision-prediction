Imagine yourself working at a consulting firm and one of the biggest clients of the firm is a bank called GermanCredit bank has called in for a new project. The bank wants your team
to help them turn into a better data driven organisation. GermanCredit Bank has collected data about their customers and wants to utilize the data to mitigate probable risk and your
consulting team is tasked with creating a logistic regression model to predict whether a loan applicant would default on his loan payments in the future.

Below are the steps involved in the entire process of creating a logstic regression model-
1. Data loading and consecutive exploration -  The customer data is first loaded in tto R environment and basic exploratory analysis conducted. In the process summary statistics
                                               and dimensions of the data was explored. 
                                               
2. Splitting the dataset into train and test - After EDA, the entire dataset into split into two parts - the first one being the training dataset having 70% of the values and second
                                               one being the test dataset having 30% of the values.
                                               
3. Creating the logistic model - In this step, we will be building an actual logistic regression model. The initial model is created using all the variables and then select variables
                                 are selected using step-wise function of R.
4. Model Evaluation - The significant parameters are identified by summary statistics and also the AIC value noted. Also the confusion matrix is drawn and the accuracy and sensitivity
                      is calculated.
